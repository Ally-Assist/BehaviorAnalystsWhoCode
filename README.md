# Purpose

During a length [discussion with the Slack channel owner, David Cox](https://behavioranaly-yw87919.slack.com/archives/D02APN949UL), I agreed to do one presentation to the Behavior Analysts Who Code Slack channel on Sunday 25 September 2021 @ 12:00 eastern USA time.

There may be additional presentations or projects in the future.

Besides the general need of classifying behaviors, we &#10;also want to collect data that will support efforts to improve the entire&#10;process: train users to classify statements; the criteria used in&#10;classifying statements; the explanations of the criteria; how the user&#10;interacts with the system; and so on.&#10;&#10;File Purpose: &lt;enter comments here&gt;&#10;&#10;Copyright Â© Performance Ally, LLC, 2021. &#10;&#10;Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);&#10; you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.&#10; You may obtain a copy of the License at&#10;&#10;       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&#10;" />

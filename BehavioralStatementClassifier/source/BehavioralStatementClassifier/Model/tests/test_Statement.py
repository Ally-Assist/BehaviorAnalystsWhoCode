#  Project: BehavioralStatementClassifier
#
#  Project Purpose: The purpose of the software is to collect and evaluate
#  statements of behavior as part of identifying behaviors important in
#  producing some result, otherwise known as, "pinpointing vital behaviors".
#  Such statements would be specific to particular domains and perhaps settings
#  within those domains. Besides the general need of classifying behaviors, we
#  also want to collect data that will support efforts to improve the entire
#  process: train users to classify statements; the criteria used in
#  classifying statements; the explanations of the criteria; how the user
#  interacts with the system; and so on.

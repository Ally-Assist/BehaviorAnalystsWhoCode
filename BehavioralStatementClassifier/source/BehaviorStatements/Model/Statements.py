    Statements is an ordered collection of statements, each with a unique
    identifier.

    These are the statements to be classified and analyzed. This statement
    collection is a repository for the statements, and provides a means of
    accessing the statements by id (vs via the text payload).

        Create collection of statements from the specified comma separated 
        values (CSV) file in the specified directory.

        The CSV file should have one statement per line, with the statement
        in the first column. If there is any formatting beyond that, such as
        special rows other than a header row, we must manually handle them
        here when we read it.

        All actual reading is done using the Python csv module. See:
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html

        Each statement is read, in order, and a Statement object is created
        for each. Each Statement object will get sequential numeric id
        starting at one. Thus, row one in the spreadsheet should be statement
        one in this collection.
        
        :param source_directory: Location of the source spreadsheat.
        Preconditions: the directory name must be a valid path to a directory
        and accessible by this code.

        :param source_CSV_filename: The name of the spreadsheet in CSV
        format. When joined to the source_directory, must form a full and
        valid path to the source file. If not, a FileNotFound error will be
        thrown.

# Purpose

During a lengthy [discussion with the Slack channel owner, David Cox](https://behavioranaly-yw87919.slack.com/archives/D02APN949UL), I agreed to do one presentation to the Behavior Analysts Who Code Slack channel on Sunday 25 September 2021 @ 12:00 eastern USA time.

David and I discussed options. The basic drivers in developing the presentation will be:

1. Software development skills of the audience are all over the place.

	1. Just starting.
	
	2. Computer science background.
	
	3. Any professional (or retired) software developers? I may be the only one.

2. Given the audience experience with software development, or the lack of it, this first presentation needs to be very general.

3. The "software development project" must be in some way relevant to behavior analysis. 

3. For the project to be intrinsically interesting to me, and to maintain my responding, it should be in some way relevant to my current work. That is, applied behavior analysis in general, or OBM in particular.

4. After discussion with, and the approval of, Julie Smith, I will use some sort of classification of textual statements as behavioral (or not) as the initial scenario.

# Overview

During a lengthy [discussion with the Slack channel owner, David Cox](https://behavioranaly-yw87919.slack.com/archives/D02APN949UL), I agreed to do one presentation to the Behavior Analysts Who Code Slack channel on Sunday 25 September 2021 @ 12:00 eastern USA time.

The focus of the presentation, or way or another, will be software development practices wrapped up in a behavior analytic scenario.

The long term goal is to help foster a deeper understanding of software development among behavior analysts to facilitate their own coding as well as make their interactions with professional software development groups more effective. Or something.

### Rationale

David and I discussed options. The basic drivers in developing the presentation will be:

1. Software development skills of the audience are all over the place.

	1. Just starting.
	
	2. Computer science background.
	
	3. Any professional (or retired) software developers? I may be the only one.

2. Given the audience experience with software development, or the lack of it, this first presentation needs to be very general.

3. The "software development project" must be in some way relevant to behavior analysis. 

3. For the project to be intrinsically interesting to me, and to maintain my responding, it should be in some way relevant to my current work. That is, applied behavior analysis in general, or OBM in particular (vs basic experimental or neural nets).

4. After discussion with, and the approval of, Julie Smith, I will use some sort of classification of textual statements as behavioral (or not) as the initial scenario.


### General Format

Each of these topics will be addressed briefly. Goal is to keep it down to about 45 minutes. Step 6, the demo, will be longest.

1. Behavior analytic scenario as the motivation for the project.

2. Overall (basic) development strategy.

3. Basic requirements for the first prototype.

4. Major software components to satisfy the requirements

5. Tools that will be used (including download links) in the initial "simple prototype" phase.

6. Present the development process.

7. Demo with live development project (will have basic framework in place, then do some coding to illustrate one important concept in more detail, e.g., test driven design)

8. Where to go from here? What might a next step be? Do it in another presentation?

# 1. Scenario

***What is the behavior analytic purpose?***

Collecting and evaluating statements of behavior as part of identifying behaviors important in producing some result, otherwise known as, "pinpointing vital behaviors".

### General Need

Would like software that would facilitate the process of training people to do the classification, and to collect classifications of large volumes of behavior statements.

The general criteria. To be a behavior, for our purposes:

1. Measurable: Must be observable by others than the performer: seen, heard, felt, smelled, tasted.

2. Objective: Must be confirmable by others.

3. Active: Only a living organism can do it (see also: Dead Man Test)

4. Neutral: Non-biased, non-judgmental, non-emotional.

A few relevant articles:

1. A "must read" by Critchfield and Shue: [The Dead Man Test: a Preliminary Experimental Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6269387/pdf/40617_2018_Article_239.pdf)

2. [How to Pinpoint Behavior Effectively](https://centralreach.com/how-to-pinpoint-behavior-effectively/): More inclusive than our current project. We will focus on the "Movement Cycle" (action verb and object).

3. [Seleting a Pinpoint](https://centralreach.com/how-to-pinpoint-behavior-effectively/).

# 2. Development Strategy

***How to break it down into digestible chunks?***


### A Possible End Goal

A system that can be used by large numbers of users evaluating large numbers of statements, marking them as to their behavioral/non-behavioral characteristics. Statistics automatically collected to decide which statements are behavioral in what ways; which statements might be modified to be behavioral, and in what ways. Inter-observer agreements by statement and characteristic. Graphs of various types to analyze quality of classifications, training needs, etc.

System would, itself learn to make such classifications and corrections, with feedback from well trained humans.

### A Practical Starting Point

A simple prototype, single-user, desktop app. Present statements and classification criteria, and collects user responses per statement. Goal: development of overall interaction style.

### A Practical Enhancement

Add user login and record/track responses to each stimuli per user in a local database. Simple graphs and tables showing results.

### Next?

# 4. Major Components (i.e., Objects) in the Software

***What code will I develop?***



---

# 5. Tools

***What software will I use to develop?***

---

# 6. Development Process

***What are the steps in using the tools to develop the major components and verifying that they work and will continue working?***

# 7. Demo: Test Driven Design (TDD)

***How will I use the tools to create "provably correct" software?***

# 8. Where to From Here?

***Is the end goal still the same? What is the next enhancement toward the goal?***

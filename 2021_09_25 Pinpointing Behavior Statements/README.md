# Overview

During a lengthy [discussion with the Slack channel owner, David Cox](https://behavioranaly-yw87919.slack.com/archives/D02APN949UL), I agreed to do one presentation to the Behavior Analysts Who Code Slack channel on Sunday 25 September 2021 @ 12:00 eastern USA time.

The focus of the presentation, or way or another, will be software development practices wrapped up in a behavior analytic scenario.

## Rationale

David and I discussed options. The basic drivers in developing the presentation will be:

1. Software development skills of the audience are all over the place.

	1. Just starting.
	
	2. Computer science background.
	
	3. Any professional (or retired) software developers? I may be the only one.

2. Given the audience experience with software development, or the lack of it, this first presentation needs to be very general.

3. The "software development project" must be in some way relevant to behavior analysis. 

3. For the project to be intrinsically interesting to me, and to maintain my responding, it should be in some way relevant to my current work. That is, applied behavior analysis in general, or OBM in particular.

4. After discussion with, and the approval of, Julie Smith, I will use some sort of classification of textual statements as behavioral (or not) as the initial scenario.


## General Format

1. Present the behavior analytic scenario as the motivation for the project.

2. Present basic development strategy (simple prototype growning into a complex one, rewrite as "real app or service").

3. Present the tools that will be used (including download links) in the initial "simple prototype" phase.

4. Present the development process.

5. Demo with live development project (will have basic framework in place, then do some coding to illustrate one important concept in more detail, e.g., test driven design)

6. Where to go from here? What might a next step be? Do it in another presentation?
